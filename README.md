- *The Avengers, American comic strip superhero team whose frequently changing roster often included some of the most popular characters in the Marvel Comics universe*
- *It gross to about 1.519 billion USD*
- *The Avengers is a movie that shines in its unique tone which balances the fun action and witty lines with its more serious and compelling thematic ideas and character journeys. All the characters are incredible, however the standout is definitely Chris Evanâ€™s Steve Rogers. A man just coming into this new world where everything he values is challenged with both Loki and Shields hawk like tactics. Watching him finding his place on the team and his relationship with the awesome Robert Downey Jr. Ironman emphasizes his worldview. Every scene immerses you in one way or another. The acting is absolutely superb and is half the reason why the interactions between our heroes is so captivating and entertaining along with the clever and intelligent writing. The action is stunningly beautiful even for being almost 10 years old. The visuals still hold up greatly. As this film came out I was just immersing myself in Avengers storylines from the comics and the Earths Mightiest Heroes show. This film came at the right time for me. Overall Amazing film and great time.*
